'''
Modules refer to a file containing Python statements 
and definitions. A file containing Python code, 
for example: example.py , is called a module, and 
its module name would be example . We use modules to 
break down large programs into small manageable and
organized files. 


Types of Modules:
1. Built-in (pre installed in python)     
2. External (need to be isntalled using pip)
