                             #Tuples (tuples are similar to lists but want modify them i-e insert, append, pop, clear etc)

# we can only use index and count methods for tuples because they dont modify tuples
numbers=(1,2,3);
print(numbers[0]);                 #1
# number[0]=20;                    #this is impossible as we cant modify tuples
